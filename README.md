# ðŸ¦€ firework(r)s ðŸ¦€

Play text art animations in your terminal! This package includes several pre-made animations like fireworks and a cozy fireplace that are embedded in the binary.

If the folder name is found on disk, firework(r)s will prefer it over the embedded animation. See below how to create your own animation :)

## Installation

```bash
cargo install fireworkrs
```

## Usage

```bash
fireworkrs [folder] [loops]
```

Parameters (all optional):
- `[folder]`: Folder containing text art frames (numbered 0.txt, 1.txt, etc.). Defaults to 'fireworks'
- `[loops]`: Number of times to loop the animation (-1 for infinite). Defaults to 20

## Examples

Run with defaults (fireworks animation, 20 loops):
```bash
fireworkrs
```

Play the fireworks animation with custom loops:
```bash
fireworkrs fireworks 3
```

Enjoy a cozy fireplace forever:
```bash
fireworkrs fireplace -1
```

## Creating Your Own Animations

1. Create a new folder for your animation
2. Add text art frames as numbered .txt files (0.txt, 1.txt, 2.txt, etc.)
3. Run fireworkrs with your folder name
